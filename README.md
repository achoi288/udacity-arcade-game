## How To Run

Open index.html in a web browser (I used Google Chrome) and test against the project rubrics, as seen below.

## How To Play

The goal of the game is to move the player from the bottom row to the top row, avoiding contact with the crawling bugs. If you run into a bug, you are moved back to the starting position. If you reach the top row, you win and are moved to the starting position.

Use the up, down, left, right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player.

Press the spacebar to change characters.
